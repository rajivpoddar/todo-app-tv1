# Architectural Design for Todo App

## Component Structure
- App: The main container component that holds the state of the todo list and renders the TodoList and TodoForm components.
- TodoForm: A component that contains the form for adding new todos. It will have an input field and a submit button.
- TodoList: A component that renders the list of TodoItem components.
- TodoItem: A component that represents a single todo item. It will display the todo text, a checkbox to mark the todo as complete, and a delete button to remove the todo from the list.

## State Management
- The App component will maintain the state of the todo list in an array of todo objects.
- Each todo object will have an id, text, and a completed property.
- The state will be passed down to the TodoList and TodoItem components as props.
- Callback functions for adding, completing, and deleting todos will also be passed down as props to the necessary child components.

## Data Flow
- Data flow will be unidirectional, from the App component down to the child components.
- The TodoForm component will lift the new todo state up to the App component when a new todo is submitted.
- The TodoItem component will inform the App component when a todo is marked as complete or deleted.

## Additional Considerations
- The application will be developed using functional components and React hooks.
- Components will be designed to be reusable and maintainable.
- The design will follow the provided UI specifications and will be responsive to different screen sizes.
