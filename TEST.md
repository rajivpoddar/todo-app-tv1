# Testing Strategy for Todo App

## Tools
- Jest: A JavaScript testing framework that works well with React applications.
- React Testing Library: A set of helpers that allow testing React components without relying on their implementation details.

## Primary Features to Test
1. Adding a new task.
2. Marking a task as complete.
3. Deleting a task.

## Edge Cases
- Adding an empty task should not be allowed.
- Marking an already completed task should not change its state.
- Deleting a task should remove it from the list and not affect other tasks.

## Testing Approach
- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) by writing tests before writing the actual code.
- Each test should cover a single functionality.
- Use mock functions and states to simulate user interactions.
- Ensure that the application behaves correctly in response to user actions.
- Test the application's performance and responsiveness.

## Continuous Integration
- Integrate tests within the CI pipeline to automatically run them on every commit.
- Ensure that all tests pass before merging any code into the main branch.

## Documentation
- Document the purpose of each test for clarity and maintainability.
- Keep the test cases updated with changes in the application's functionality.
